:::pantheon Pantheon Front-End Sites

Decoupled Kit is an open source project built by Pantheon. These docs focus on
using Decoupled Kit components locally or anywhere.

For more information on Pantheon Front-End Sites, see
https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/decoupled/

Sections or documents that are related specifically to Pantheon will include this callout at the top of the section or page.
:::

Decoupled Kit is a collection of utilities for building a decoupled front-end
that sources data from a CMS back-end. Conceptually, a “Kit” is a combination of
a compatible CMS back end and JavaScript front end. For example, we have kits
with WordPress + Gatsby, WordPress + Next.js, and Drupal + Next.js.

At a slightly lower level, Decoupled Kit is a series of CMS starter projects,
front-end starter kits, and developer documentation. Let’s take a closer look at
each of these focus areas.

## Frontend

### `decoupled-kit-js` Monorepo

The `decoupled-kit-js` monorepo is home to all of the open source starter kits
and [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=@pantheon-systems/*-kit) which
provide a starting point for developers who want an out-of-the-box experience
for headless WordPress and Drupal powered by modern JavaScript/TypeScript tools.

### Starter Kits

To create a new starter kit locally, use the `create-pantheon-decoupled-kit` npm
package. Follow the prompts to build your desired output. See
[create-pantheon-decoupled-kit](./Frontend%20Starters/create-pantheon-decoupled-kit.md)
for detailed information

The starters described below represent the output of the base generators,
`gatsby-wp`, `next-wp`, and `next-drupal + next-drupal-umami-addon`. These
starters include TailwindCSS for styling.

Read on for a brief overview of each starter. Check each starter's `README.md`
for more detailed information.

#### Gatsby WordPress Starter

The
[`gatsby-wordpress-starter`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/gatsby-wordpress-starter)
is a [Gatsby](https://v4.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) app which consumes data from a
WordPress backend with the
[WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) and
[WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/) plugins, and uses Gatsby as
a Static Site Generator.

This starter implements:

- [`wordpress-kit`](#wordpress-kit)

#### Next Drupal Starter

The
[`next-drupal-starter`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/next-drupal-starter)
is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) app which consumes data from Drupal with
the [JSON:API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) module, as well as some
Drupal modules managed by Pantheon (see [Drupal](#drupal) below for more
information) and uses Next's Server Side Rendering.

This starter implements:

- [`nextjs-kit`](#nextjs-kit)
- [`drupal-kit`](#drupal-kit)

#### Next WordPress Starter

The
[`next-wordpress-starter`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/next-wordpress-starter)
is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) app which consumes data from a WordPress
backend with the [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) plugin,
and uses Next's Server Side Rendering.

This starter implements:

- [`nextjs-kit`](#nextjs-kit)
- [`wordpress-kit`](#wordpress-kit)

### npm Packages

To help fetch data, set headers, or style markup from the CMS, we have developed
a set of open source tools that are published to npm. These tools are used in
the starter kits, and can be imported into any project.

Packages can be installed with your node package manager of choice. The
following example uses `npm` to install `drupal-kit` and `nextjs-kit` as
production dependencies in a node project:

```bash
npm i @pantheon-systems/drupal-kit @pantheon-systems/nextjs-kit
```

Read on for a brief overview of each npm package. Please see the `README.md` in
each package's repo for more detailed information.

#### `cms-kit`

The [`cms-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pantheon-systems/cms-kit) exports
utilities used in both [`drupal-kit`](#drupal-kit) and
[`wordpress-kit`](#wordpress-kit). Those utilities are re-exported from the CMS
specific packages for use in the starters.

#### `drupal-kit`

The [`drupal-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit)
utilizes [`@gdwc/drupal-state`](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_state), a
TypeScript library for fetching and storing data from Drupal's JSON:API.
`@gdwc/drupal-state` lives on https://drupal.org, and is maintained by the
Decoupled Kit team along with members of the Drupal community. Please visit
https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_state for more information on DrupalState.

`drupal-kit` exports a `PantheonDrupalState` class that utilizes some methods
from [`cms-kit`](#cms-kit) to efficiently fetch and cache data from Drupal on
Pantheon.

#### `wordpress-kit`

The
[`wordpress-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pantheon-systems/wordpress-kit)
exports a light wrapper around `graphql-request` which is used to make GraphQL
requests to a WordPress instances using the
[WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) plugin.

It also exports a [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) plugin which maps
WordPress Block Editor styles to tailwindcss classes. Import the plugin into
your tailwindcss config to see the Block Editor styles on your content sourced
from WordPress.

#### `nextjs-kit`

The [`nextjs-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pantheon-systems/nextjs-kit)
exports shared components used in the Next.js based starter kits, as well as
some shared helpers.

## Backend

To facilitate the Frontend Starter Kits, we also maintain WordPress and Drupal
projects as starting points for the CMS side of things. These templates are open
source and include community and Decoupled Kit managed WordPress plugins and
Drupal modules.

Read on for a brief overview of each project. Please see the `README.md` in each
project's repo for more detailed information.
